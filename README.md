My first OpenGL Engine, written in Delphi.

#What's this?
This is a 3D engine, written in Delphi. It was never meant to be used for games, more for visualization of geospatial datasets. That's why the terrain engine is by far the most advanced feature of this engine.

It was supposed to be used in my Aion Online client, which aimed to be a complete replacement for the Aion client, a Korean MMORPG.

Please do ignore any swear words you may encounter, since I had a lot of problems concerning Aion's Geometry format, and am too lazy to dig through comments.

#Show me something cool!
Here you go, terrain rendering in action:
